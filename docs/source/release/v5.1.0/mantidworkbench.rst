New
###

- The Advanced Plotting menu is now in Workbench. This enables creating surface and contour plots of three or more workspaces, and choosing which log value to plot against.
- There is now a dialog for project saving that allows you to choose between saving all workspaces or only saving workspaces which have been altered.
- A default legend location can be set in the Workbench settings.
- The Sample Transmission Calculator is now implemented in workbench.
- The axis tick markers in a plot can be switched between Log and decimal formats independently of the axes scale.
- Axes limits and labels can be set simultaneously for all subplots with the `Apply to all` button.
- A default font for plots can now be set in the workbench settings.

Improvements
############

.. figure:: ../../images/Plot1DSelectionDialog5-1.png
   :align: right

- The plot selection dialog now correctly shows the full range of valid spectra to plot, not just the min to max range.
- We have added a Copy to Clipboard button to the plot window.
- Tile plots are now reloaded correctly by project recovery.
- When you stop a script running in workbench it will now automatically attempt to cancel the algorithm the script is running, rather than wait for the current algorthm to end.
  This is similar to what Mantidplot does, and should result in the script stopping much sooner.
- The ``Python extensions directory`` setting from MantidPlot is now available in Workbench within the Manage User Directories window.
- The script generation functionality attached to workbench plots will now include fitting code if the user has performed a fit.

.. figure:: ../../images/wb_invalid_log_shading.png
   :align: right

- Logs that contain invalid data indicated by NeXus log alarm states are now shaded in red, and a tool tip will tell you how many values are invalid.
- Fixed an issue where some scripts were running slower if a  plot was open at the same time.
- The Help Menu now has an About screen that will pop up automatically on startup to provide links to the release notes and various other resources, and allow you to set some important setting such as Facility, instrument and accept usage tracing.
  You can choose to hide it until the next release.
- There is now an option to create a 3D plot (surface, wireframe, contour) when you right-click a workspace.
- The Sample Logs Dialog now lets you view the complete log data as well as filtered data which only includes values for the current period, the running status, and with invalid values removed.  Just click the "Filtered Data" checkbox to swap between them.
- The axes tab in the figure options can now be used to set the limits, label, and scale of the z-axis on 3D plots.
- The "Show sample logs" dialog will now hide the plot and statistics display if there are no suitable logs in the workspace that need it.  This is particularly applicable for some of the reactor based instruments.
- The plot toolbar now shows the correct buttons for 3D plots.
- Plots now have a Help button on the toolbar, which will direct the user to a relevant documentation page informing them about that type of plot.
- Colorfill plots can now be scripted just like line plots, as long as there is only one colorfill on the plot.
- On 3D plots you can now double-click on the z-axis to change its limits or label.
- Plots extracted from "Show Sample Logs" by double clicking the plot can now be converted to a python script, just like other workbench plots.
- The workspace sample logs interface now responds to keyboard input from the cursor keys to move between logs.
- We have neatened up the the slice viewer user interface, to reduce the amount of wasted space and devote more to the data view itself.
- We have implemented the interactive  plot details functionality from the SpectrumViewer in Mantidplot into the slice viewer there is now a table of details that update as you move your cursor over the data this includes the diension value and signal for multidimensional workspaces, and for matrix workspaces with a spectrum axis:
   - Signal
   - Spectra Number
   - Detector ID
   - Two Theta
   - Azimuthal Angle
   - Time of Flight
   - Wavelength
   - Energy
   - d-Spacing
   - Mod Q
- Surface plots no longer spill over the axes when their limits are reduced.
- The instrument view now ignores non-finite (infinity and NaN) values and should now display workspaces containing those values.
  If there are no valid values for that detector the value will appear as invalid (grayed out).
  It can also now display negative values in workspaces correctly.
- The gray and plasma colormaps have been added to the instrument view.
- Slow running algorithms will now display an estimated time to completion in their progress bars.
- The x-axis tick labels on colorfill plots are now horizontal.
- Improved the usability of the fit function and peak selection pop-up menus by allowing the user to immediately search for the desired function and activate autocompletion by pressing "enter" if there is just a single possible function.
- The figure options menu now has a help button which opens the documentation for the menu.
- Added a profiling option to the workbench launch script, allowing for timing of startup and other internal processes.
- Variables assigned in python scripts are now cleared when a script is run in its entirety.
- The colorbar on colorfill plots is now labelled, and the label can be set in the figure options.
- Monitors are no longer shown on bin and colorfill plots.
- User data directories are no longer checked at startup, reducing launch times with slow network drives.
- When choosing a marker in the figure options, if one of the marker colours would not be used that selection is disabled.
- There are now options in the settings window and the figure options for showing minor ticks and minor gridlines on plots.
- Added an option to set the default ```drawstyle``` within the workbench settings window. Additionally, the ```linestyle``` can now be set to 'None'.
- Added a button to the workbench settings window to save and load the settings to and from a file so they can be shared with others
- Added an option to matrix workspaces to export bins and spectra to a table workspace.
- Improved the handling of ``WorkspaceSingleValue`` workspaces in workbench. This fixes a crash which occurred when interacting with workspaces of this type.
- Right-clicking a plot without dragging while using the zoom tool now resets the axes limits.
- The Slice Viewer now starts with the zoom option selected by default.
- The curves in the dropdown list in the Curves tab of the figure options are now listed in the same order as the plot legend.

.. figure:: ../../images/instrument_view_sector.png
   :align: right
   :width: 400px

- Added an option in the settings to specify the default legend size.
- Added an option to the settings window to set the default colormap for image plots.
- Improved loading of python plugins at startup on slow disks.
- Added a circular sector shape in the Pick and Mask tab of the instrument view.
- Workbench will now spot if it is about to create the settings window off the available screen, and will move it so it is all visible. This is important as it is a modal dialog and could freeze the application in an unrecoverable way before.
- Sliceviewer no longer lists the reversed colourmaps along with the regular, instead they are accessed with a reverse checkbox.
- Sliceviewer colourmap uses the default colourmap from the settings.
- Code completions are now loaded when the code editor is first changed.

Bugfixes

- Fixed the bug that caused the fit browser on plots to reset size changes on mouse interactions with the figure.
- Fix crash when subscribing algorithms from a separate thread

  flagging the old ``launch_workbench.exe`` as a threat and quarantining it.
- Fixed a bug when origin=upper was passed into imshow.
