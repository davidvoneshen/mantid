    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Powder Diffraction
------------------
New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- New ``D7`` instrument definition for ILL 

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Polaris.create_total_scattering_pdf output workspaces now have the run number in the names.
- Polaris.create_total_scattering_pdf no longer takes `output_binning` as a parameter, instead binning of the output pdf can be controlled with `delta_r`.
- Polaris.create_total_scattering_pdf can rebin the Q space workspace before calculating the PDF by being given an input `delta_q`.
- SampleDetails.set_materials now differentiates between sample density and crystal density for converting between pdf types.
- :ref:`LoadWAND <algm-LoadWAND>` now adds `duration` log to the workspace
- Polaris.create_total_scattering_pdf now no longer calculates the PDF with the Lorch filter enabled by default and must be enabled.
- :ref:`PDFFourierTransform <algm-PDFFourierTransform>` has been updated to allow for the algorithm to be run on a PDF to obtain a spectrum density function.
- :ref:`CalculatePlaczekSelfScattering <algm-CalculatePlaczekSelfScattering>` now accepts the crystalographic density of the sample to correct for the powder density.
- Square beam profile of 5mm x 5mm added to the PEARL_Definition_new_lowangle instrument definition file
- running `Polaris.create_total_scattering_pdf` with `debug=true` will preserve the `self_scattering_correction` workspace.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- The fourier filter on Polaris.create_total_scattering_pdf no longer produces a jagged mark at the cut off point.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------
New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- New algorithm for estimating background of powder spectra :ref:`EnggEstimateFocussedBackground <algm-EnggEstimateFocussedBackground>` using iterative smoothing.
- Mantid fitting capability added to fitting tab of Engineering Diffraction UI (with simpler fitpropertybrowser providing only relevant options).
- Mantid fitting capability added to fitting tab of Engineering Diffraction UI.
- Added support for a Circular Beam Profile for use with Monte Carlo Absorption

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- TOPAS files (`.abc`) have replaced the `.dat` files generated when focusing using the GUI.
- Focusing with the GUI will now generate a CSV containing the averaged values of all numerical sample logs.
- The currently loaded calibration is now shown at the bottom of the GUI.
- The location of the saved output files from the GUI is now shown in the messages log.
- The save directory is now displayed in the status bar of the GUI.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- The Engineering diffraction gui no longer goes behind the workbench window when a plot is clicked on.

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------
Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- :ref:`CombinePeaksWorkspaces <algm-CombinePeaksWorkspaces>` now combines the modulation vectors present in the two workspaces, provided the total number of vectors is less than 3.
- New algorithm :ref:`FindGoniometerFromUB <algm-FindGoniometerFromUB-v1>` for making UBs for runs at different goniometer angles share common indexing and determine the goniometer axis and rotation required to match UBs to a reference.
- New instrument geometry for MaNDi instrument at SNS
- New algorithm :ref:`AddAbsorptionWeightedPathLengths <algm-AddAbsorptionWeightedPathLengths-v1>` for calculating the absorption weighted path length for each peak in a peaks workspace. The absorption weighted path length is used downstream from Mantid in extinction correction calculations
- Can now edit H,K,L in the table of a peaks workspace in workbench (now consistent with Mantid Plot)

:ref:`Release 5.1.0 <v5.1.0>`
